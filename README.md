# ATM
It is a simple simulator of an ATM, it verifies the existence of the account and the PIN. It is a database simulator, if it finds the data entered it gives you access and you can carry out operations


The only thing that needs to be modified for the code to work is to change the path from which the database.txt file takes, 
these changes would be made in the checkAccount class, getBalance and updateBalanceDatabase
